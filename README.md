<h2>Usage</h2>
Run the EXE to launch the app. It lives in you system tray, but you can drag it onto the taskbar to make it more accesable. Click on the icon to open your feed, click it again to close the feed, and right click it to pull up the menu. You can update your interests while the app is running to experiment and find what you want to see. Refresh the feed manually (right click menu) to see these changes reflected. to Changes to the config will not take effect until after closing (use the right click menu) and reopening the application.

Note that the first time you launch this it may take a second to load the feed, and refreshes can also be slow.

By default the application updates every 3 hours but this can be changed in the config file.
